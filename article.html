            <p>"Chimichangas!" may be Deadpool's catchphrase and favorite word, but one particular hero featured in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has had enough.</p>
            <p>Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe may be surprised at which Guardians of the Galaxy hero is the most critical of Deadpool's infamous catchphrase. "Chimichangas!" is the meme-worthy slogan of the Merc with a Mouth and since its introduction, it's been one of Wade Wilson's most notable, and annoying, tics. However, a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy has made their thoughts known on the line in a possible dig towards Deadpool's constant chanting of the word. Deadpool's association with the deep-fried dish got its start in Cable and Deadpool #13, when Wilson took a liking to the sound of "chimichanga". While he admitted he had no clue what a chimichanga actually was, it didn't stop him from repeatedly saying it. The joke served its purpose for the issue, and while it seemed more fit as a one-off gag, other writers grabbed that ball and ran with it, creating a running gag so notable, that Hasbro even has a Deadpool chimichangas line of toys. But not everyone is a fan chimichangas, or at the very least, Wilson's incessant use of the word.</p><img src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Deadpool-Chimichangas-Marvel-Comics.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&dpr=1.5">
            <p>In Guardians of the Galaxy #15 by Brian Michael Bendis, Ed McGuinness, Kevin Maguire, Mark Bagley, Sara Pichelli, Star-Lord voiced his resolute disapproval of the word in a comedic moment with his teammate, Rocket Racoon. Rocket has come up with what he feels is a decent battle cry for the team. He suggests "Chimichangas!" as the perfect line before a fight, but Peter Quill vehemently turns Rocket down. Poor Rocket can't even get support from his longtime confidante, Groot, who also rejects his friend's pitch.</p>
            <p>As disappointed as Rocket is, it's probably for the best that Star-Lord shot the idea down. Since the initial gag, Deadpool and chimichangas have been practically joined at the hip. Wade Wilson has been seen with chimichangas in posters and action figures and was even an important part of Deadpool's appearance in Fortnite. The running gag also got acknowledged in a trailer for the 2016 Deadpool film when Deadpool uses a giant chimichanga to present a case for seeing the movie in IMAX. Needless to say, Deadpool has gotten a lot of mileage out of chimichangas, so Star-Lord was probably right to turn Rocket down. While there was humor in the initial usage of the phrase, its overuse has watered down the comedic effect. Considering how ubiquitous Deadpool's catchphrase was at the time of Guardians of the Galaxy #15's publication, Star-Lord's disapproval could be seen as a criticism over Marvel letting the chimichanga meme grow as large as it did. The critique may not have been intended as a slight, but Star-Lord seemed determined to put an end to the chimichanga meme where he could. Before Deadpool potentially wanders into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he may want to consider another catchphrase should he ever cross paths with the Guardians of the Galaxy's Star-Lord.</p>
